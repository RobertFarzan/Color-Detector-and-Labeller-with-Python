## :newspaper: Description 

This little project aims to develop a simple GUI to upload your images and read the specific colorname you may want to know from a part of the picture. It is entirely developed in __Python3__, so pay attention to the following pre-requisites for the application in order to work.

## Pre-requisites

 - **Python3** (Python 2.7 not supported)
 - **Pandas for Python3** (used version: pandas 1.1.0)
 - **Tkinter for Python3** (used version: Tk 8.6) 
 - **PIL** (used version: PIL 8.3.1)

## :rocket: How to run the application

Having checked all the previous pre-requisites, to run the program there's just a simple step:

```
$ python3 main.py
```

To use the application, it is as simple as loading your desired picture and click on the part of the image you want to know the name of the color. A little red square indicates the zone being pointed out.
